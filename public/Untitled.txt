Lets fix the flow of the onboarding process. When a user opens/visits the web app, this is the order of  of onboarding process.
1). The splash screen @SplashScreen.tsx first
2). If the user is just visiting the web app for the first time, the @FirstLaunch.tsx second.
This 2 pages comes first before any form of authentication.

Note: Price modal @PricingModal.tsx will only show once, which is 10 seconds after passing the authentication checks. The modal will not show until 10 seconds after the entire on-boarding process is completed and user is on homepage. This are the supporting files: @AppRoutes.tsx, @PricingContext.tsx, @useFirstLaunch.ts, @useAuth.ts, and @App.tsx.
